States on the sound principle of greatest service to the greatest number
of men and women in every substantial walk of life.

_New York Evening Journal_]

Mr. Brisbane writes editorials for the New York Evening Journal and has
done so for many years. His daily editorials are one of the outstanding
reasons why nearly half of all the people in Metropolitan New York, who
buy any New York evening paper, buy the New York Evening Journal every
day.




ACCURACY

THE FIRST LAW OF THE NEWS

"_Get it_ FIRST, _but first get it_ RIGHT"

THE SLOGAN OF

New York Evening Journal News Gathering Staff


All through its local news staff as well as through the International
News Service Staff the gospel of GET IT RIGHT is stressed and reiterated
twenty-four hours in the day. The man who can't get the habit of
ACCURACY can't stay in this organization though he be the most brilliant
writer living. "_Get it_ FIRST but _first_ get it RIGHT" is at once a
fearless challenge and a solemn pledge of faith.

NEWS PICTURES

WHAT THE CAMERA'S EYE SEES


One good picture is worth ten thousand words, says an old proverb. The
Evening Journal is invariably FIRST in serving its readers with
accurate, informative, illuminating and exclusive news pictures. Each
picture must pass the scrutiny of the most critical staff of experts to
be good enough for reproduction in the Evening Journal. New Yorkers know
they get better and more interesting pictures in the Evening Journal
than in any other New York newspaper.




_SPEED_

MEANS LIFE TO THE NEWS


_You may have the news beat of a century on your desk. Hold it a half
hour too long--long enough for another paper to print it_ FIRST--_and
for you it is_ YESTERDAY'S NEWS _with all the_ LIFE _ebbed out of it._

The News Policy of the NEW YORK EVENING JOURNAL can be summarized in
five sentences:

_Give all the vital news of the moment._
  _Give it cleanly._
    _Give it accurately._
      _Give it interestingly._
        _Give it succinctly._

Back of this clean-cut, vigorous policy of news presentation is the
finest reportorial and editorial talent that money can buy.

Local news printed in the New York Evening Journal is furnished by the
most adequate staff of reporters and special writers retained by any
evening newspaper in the city.

Telegraphic news is furnished by the International News Service--with
well equipped offices not only in New York but in Washington, London,
Paris, Rome, Moscow, Peking--with expert representatives all over the
world. In New York City's evening newspaper field International News
Service serves the New York Evening Journal _exclusively_.




LARGEST AND HIGHEST PAID LOCAL NEWS STAFF IN NEW YORK CITY


"Get it FIRST, but first get it RIGHT"--that is the slogan of the New
York Evening Journal's news-gathering staff. This newspaper employs the
largest staff of men and women reporters, photographers, and news
writers of any evening newspaper in America. It pays the highest
salaries and this policy attracts the most capable and brilliant talent.

INTERNATIONAL NEWS SERVICE REPORTS NEWS OF THE WORLD FOR EVENING JOURNAL
READERS


International News Service has firmly established itself as the dominant
press service in the afternoon newspaper field. Its news dispatches,
gathered from every corner of the universe, likewise are published in
newspapers throughout the civilized world. International News Service is
truly international in scope, linking the foremost nations in a
comprehensive news-gathering and news-distributing chain.

Approximately 60,000 miles of leased wire, used and controlled by
International News Service, distributes its news reports to the Evening
Journal alone in New York and to more than 500 other daily newspapers in
the United States. By cable and radio International News Service
dispatches are sent to sixteen foreign nations in both hemispheres.
Editors of the leading newspapers in Germany, Great Britain, Italy,
Spain, Japan, Norway, Switzerland, Sweden, Brazil, Chile, Argentina and
numerous other countries place the same reliance upon the International
News Service reports as do the editors of leading American afternoon
dailies.

International News Service is operated under the able General
Managership of Frank Mason, former chief of the Paris Bureau.

Collection and preparation of its news reports is in the hands of a
highly trained staff of editors and correspondents. This staff is
directed by Barry Faris, General News Manager, who has had more than a
dozen years' experience in press association work and knows thoroughly
every detail of the service.

George R. Holmes heads a large staff at Washington. Holmes, himself, is
an outstanding authority on news from the National capital, a keen
observer, a vivid writer. William K. Hutchinson, Kenneth Clark, George
Durno, Lawrence Sullivan and William S. Neal are members of the
Washington corps whose achievements have made them widely known to
newspaper editors and readers throughout the United States.

Copeland C. Burg, in Chicago, Ellis H. Martin in San Francisco and other
staff men in all the leading cities in the United States get the news
for International News Service and write it in individualistic style for
New York Evening Journal readers.

The International News Service Foreign Staff is a large one. Harry K.
Reynolds, Director of Foreign Service, with headquarters in New York,
was formerly Manager of the London bureau, and he knows intimately every
phase of the foreign service. Harry R. Flory, Manager in London;
Frederic K. Abbott, Manager in Paris, and Otto D. Tolischus, Manager in
Berlin, not only have done noteworthy work in covering the big news
stories themselves, but direct a network of correspondents in their
respective territories that literally covers the world for International
News Service. Edward L. Deuss in Moscow, Guglielmo Emanuel in Rome and
Harold Ballou in Madrid are capable members of the foreign staff who
know their fields thoroughly. Correspondents are maintained as well in
China, Japan, the Philippines, various South American countries and
elsewhere at strategic points for news coverage.

International News Service correspondents at home and abroad have only
one rule to guide them. That is to get the news and get it right.
Generally, as well, they get it FIRST for New York Evening Journal
readers.




BIG NEWS

_TWO DAYS IN ADVANCE!_


The story of three men in the Arctic.

Above them the cold, gray sky, washed by an impenetrable fog.

Around them only crashing icebergs, each second grinding out a new
variety of the age-old Arctic death threat.

One man injured, unable to continue.

Then the story of the dying man who consigned himself to an icy grave
that his mates might save themselves. And the story of the two men who,
faced with this dilemma, left their pal to die, alone with his thoughts.
Leering icebergs grinding out the death march.

This is the story of Dr. Finn Malmgren and Captains Marianno and Zappi.

It first became known to the world when the New York Evening Journal
printed International News Service dispatches via Moscow on Friday, July
13, 1928. The Evening Journal's headlines then read:

     "MALMGREN DESERTED BY MATES;
     NOT DEAD WHEN ABANDONED"

It wasn't until Sunday, July 15, that other New York papers printed the
gripping story the Evening Journal had given New York on Friday, July
13.

The Evening Journal is _always_ ACCURATE--and FIRST

[Illustration: MARY T. DOUGHERTY

_Editor of Women's News_]

outstanding among the few. Her life's work is dedicated to promoting
greater happiness, greater opportunity and greater influence for women.
She knows America's great women, leaders in social, educational, civic
and political spheres. She devotes all her knowledge, experience and
ability to keeping the Evening Journal overwhelmingly FIRST as a home
newspaper.

Thorough newspaper man who has grown up with the Bronx and uptown New
York. Writes editorials on local topics. Conducts "'ROUND UPTOWN"
column. Edits a real neighborhood section.

He knows the problems of the human race. Simplicity of thought and
staunch adherence to an uncompromising philosophy of optimism
distinguish the work of Dr. Frank Crane. His writings are helpful,
encouraging, inspirational. His followers are legion. Thousands of
Evening Journal readers in New York City and suburbs look forward to his
daily articles. His wisdom marks the paths for a happy life.


[Illustration: "BILLY BENEDICK," SOCIETY EDITOR]

"Billy Benedick" ... who is he? He is a member of the most exclusive and
highly placed society set of New York. His newsy quips and chatter about
the doings of socially prominent men and women have established one of
the most extensively read Society News Pages in New York. "Billy
Benedick's" identity is kept secret as his work would obviously be
handicapped were it to be made public.


[Illustration: ELSIE ROBINSON, AUTHOR

"_Listen World!_"]

Elsie Robinson is, like Dr. Crane, a philosopher ... but one would
hardly call her gentle. She is brisk, though never brusque in setting
forth her views. She likes to jog people out of mental ruts and, judging
by her tremendous popularity among the countless thousands of Evening
Journal readers throughout New York City and its suburbs, they like to
have her do it. Her advice is sound and well taken.


[Illustration: HELEN ROWLAND, AUTHOR

"_Meditations of a Wife_"]

Often referred to as America's "Bernard Shaw," and as America's wittiest
woman. Satire sparkles through her writings. Her observations on the
foibles of men and women, the joys and sorrows of love and marriage, and
the relief or the lack of it in divorce are always brilliant and
entertaining, yet always "said with a smile." Helen, like George Cohan,
says: "I always leave 'em laughing when I say good-bye."


[Illustration: WILLIAM WRIGHT, FINANCIAL COUNSELOR

_Investors' Service Bureau_]

characterize his reports. In close contact with the financial world, he

investment--_totaling approximately_ $10,000,000.
